Project Title
The project aims to create a Solidity smart contract for a basic token system called "KPcoin." This token contract facilitates token minting and burning operations, allowing users to create and destroy tokens within the system. The primary purpose of the contract is to provide a simple framework for managing token balances and total token supply on the Ethereum blockchain. Simple overview of use/purpose.

Description
The project entails the development of a Solidity smart contract to establish a token system named "KPcoin." This contract enables users to interact with the token by minting new tokens and burning existing ones. The contract includes functionalities to manage token balances for different addresses and to track the total token supply. "KPcoin" serves as a foundational component for various decentralized applications (DApps) and token-based systems running on the Ethereum blockchain. Its versatility allows developers to integrate it into projects ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to gaming ecosystems and beyond. With a clear focus on simplicity and efficiency, the contract provides a straightforward solution for token management, empowering developers to build innovative blockchain applications with ease.
